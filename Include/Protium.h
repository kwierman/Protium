	\section intro Introduction

	This is the placeholder simulation for Neutron Flux at low depths (NeutronFlux, or NeuFlux for short).
	The purpose of this software is to 
	
	\section downloading Downloading Software

	This software is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. 
	The URL for the repository is: https://github.com/kwierman/Protium .

	Pulling from the repository can be accomplished by downloading <a href="https://github.com/">Git</a>
	
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	git clone https://github.com/kwierman/Protium.git
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	It is advisable that if the software is being worked on to create a separate branch. 
	This can be accomplished with the following line:

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Pushing to the repository can be accomplished with the following command:

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	git push -u origin <your_branch_name>
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	---

	\section dep Dependencies

	The following libraries must be built and in the paths in order to build properly:

	-  CMake
		- <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake Website</a>
		- Required for building the program
	- pthread.h
	    - Required for threading models
	    - Available on most Unix platforms


	---

	\section building Building

	Protium prohibits building within the directory tree. Therefore the following definitions will be made:

	- <source_directory>
	    - Where the source is located
	- <build_directory>
	    - Where the build will be located
	    - It's advised that for naming conventions, that this be similar to the source directory

	In order to generate build files for the program, issue the following command(s):

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	cd <build_directory>
	cmake <source_directory>
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Or, to use the graphical editor:

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	cd <build_directory>
	ccmake <source_directory>
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
	If configuring cmake and generating build files 

	\subsection nix_build Unix-Like Systems

	This includes MacOSX (Darwin).
	The commands to issue at this point are:

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	make
	make install
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Make sure to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or, on Darwin, `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the location of the libraries.
	This will be automated in the future.

	\subsection windows_build Windows

	<!--Open the build solution in windows by either clicking on `Protium.vcproj`, or opening 'Visual Studio' and open the solution 'Protium'.

	Once Visual Studio has completed parsing the documents, navigate `Solution->Build->Release` or hit the green arrow.
	-->

	\warning There are no plans to make Protium Windows-compatable.

	\section running Running

	Protium will include unit tests

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	<name of exec> <optional path to macro>
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	The source code for the main executables is found in the Applications/ folder

	\section code_hierarchy Code Hierarchy

	Protium is designed to be a <b>VERY</b> modular library. Every module will have a header for the full library located in the directory.

	\note Example:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	#include <Protium/LinearAlgebra/LinearAlgebra.h>
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	

	All headers are included in the top-down file, Protium.h .

	The following modules are part of the Protium libraries

	 - Design
	 	- Provides design technologies. Specifically, assertions, dimensionful quantities and types
	 	- Dependencies:
	 		- None
	 - Threads
	 	- Provides threading technologies
	 	- Explicit Dependencies:
	 		- Design
	 - Singleton
	 	- Defines singleton utilities such as creation and deletion policies
	 	- Explicit Dependencies:
	 		- Threads
	 		- Design
	 - Utilites
	 	- Miscellanious utility functions
	 	- Explicit Dependencies:
	 		- Singleton
	 - Allocation
	 	- Provides base classes for small object allocation
	 	- Explicit Dependencies:
	 		- Threads
	 		- Design
	 		- Singleton
	 - Linear Algebra
	 	- Provides matrix and vector classes to perform linear algebra
	 	- Explicit Dependencies:
	 		- Allocation
	 - Containers
	 	- Provides histogram and function classes for data storage
	 	- Explicit Dependencies:
	 		- Allocation
